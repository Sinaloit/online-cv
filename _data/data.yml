      I had the privilege of working with Patrick for nearly a decade here at NTT DATA. During this time, Patrick was part of my Technical Solutions team, with a primary focus on Customer Experience (CX) and Collaboration projects, mainly in the Cisco practice. Patrick consistently delivered exceptional results in client-facing roles, assisting, implementing, and consulting across NTT DATA's diverse client base. His leadership on projects frequently earned perfect Net Promoter Scores, a testament to his technical expertise and commitment. Patrick’s combination of deep technical acumen and positive, proactive attitude created strong client relationships—even in challenging situations when projects did not go as planned. Many clients requested Patrick by name on upcoming bookings, a testament to the relationships and trust he has built up over the years.
      
      In addition to project delivery, Patrick served as a trusted advisor to both clients and internal teams. He worked closely with Sales on client discussions, scoping new opportunities, and validating pricing and effort for CX and Collaboration initiatives. His professionalism, collaborative spirit, and ability to simplify complex solutions made him an invaluable resource.
      
      It was truly a pleasure working with Patrick, and I am confident his skills, experience, and character will be an asset to any organization as he embarks on the next phase of his career.
